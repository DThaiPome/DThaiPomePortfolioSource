            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p> <i>Chlorophyll</i> is a fast-paced time management game
              prototype, designed to comment on the stress that students with
              worsened mental health go through. Throughout the game, the player
              must split their time between maintaining the health of a potted
              plant and completing a barrage of assignments that arrive
              regularly. Each assignment is a puzzle that must be fully solved.
              The player can partially solve it and still submit it, but this
              will cause the health of the plant to deteriorate faster. </p>
            <p> This project was made with a small group as a final project for our Games &amp;
              Society class. The actual assignment was only to produce a game
              design document, which we did too, but we also wanted to go a step
              further and produce a functional, aesthetically-decorated
              prototype. While my teammates worked on the graphics and user
              interfaces, I programmed the game mechanics and systems. In
              particular, I anticipated that we may expand on the project
              further. So, while the prototype only has one type of assignment,
              a Lights out! puzzle, the code is structured in an heavily
              object-oriented manner such that new types of assignments can be
              added without rewriting any code.</p>
            <p> More details regarding the process of building the game can be
              found at the linked GitHub page. </p>
