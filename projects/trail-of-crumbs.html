            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p>Trail of Crumbs* is a game produced for the Game Programming
              class at Northeastern University. It was developed over the span
              of two months by a team of four programmers, including myself. It
              is a first-person stealth game, in which the player must use a
              long-reach grapple hand to pull themself to hard-to-reach areas
              and navigate to a target point in each level. The player must
              avoid the many eyes trying to find and apprehend them, like
              spotlights, robot guards, and an aggressive train conductor. There
              are several interesting ways for the player to navigate through
              levels, including reverse-gravity fields and a power-up that lets
              the player reach farther with their grapple hand. In the end, the
              player must thwart smuggling efforts and eventually defeat the
              crime boss known as Crumbs Banks. </p>
            <p>My focus on this project was on the different ways the player
              interacted with each level. Among other things, I wrote code for
              the grapple hand, the power-ups, the reverse-gravity fields, and
              the color-switching lights that are seen later in the game. My
              primary collaborative challenge was to develop game components
              that could be used by my teammates, and that would be compatible
              with the components my teammates developed. I accomplished this by
              making my components single-purpose and open-ended. As an example,
              the player's grapple hand is not dependent on a specific player
              object, but instead can be used when paired with any Unity object.
              Employing this strategy in my development helped reduce the number
              of conflicts that arose between two different programmers, and
              helped us produce a game with so many features in such a short
              amount of time. </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Applied 3D game development techniques such as path finding,
                finite-state machines, and vector and quaternion mathematics.</li>
              <li>Integrated 3D character animations using Unity's animation
                system.</li>
              <li>Integrated several high-quality art assets into the game.</li>
              <li>Organized the design of several game mechanics that all
