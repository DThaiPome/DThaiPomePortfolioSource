            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p> <i>Narcoleptic Nummies</i> is a video game project made during
              Game Maker Tool Kit's Game Jam held online over the summer of
              2020. The player jumps through many levels, and every ten or so
              seconds the level's layout and environment switch between being
              "awake" and "asleep". In addition to producing original music and
              sound effects, I designed and implemented the dynamic sound system
              that would switch between two parallel "waking" and "sleeping"
              versions of one original level soundtrack. </p>
            <p> I accomplished this by using Unity's flexible object hierarchy
              system alongside principles of object-oriented design.
              Specifically, I first created "looper" objects to seamlessly loop
              one music track, by fading in a new playback of the track as the
              previous one faded out. Then, I created "double looper" objects to
              play music with two of these "loopers" simultaneously, with one
              silenced, and fade between them when needed. I planned and
              implemented this code under the time crunch of the game jam. And,
              because the "double loopers" had such simple interfaces, the task
              of integrating this functionality into the game was trivial. </p>
            <p> The game went on to rank #465 in art &amp; presentation, out of
              over 5000 submissions! </p>

            <h2> Responsibilities: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Produced 2 parallel versions of one original music track using
                Sunvox, a "sleep" version and an "awake" version.</li>
              <li>Designed &amp; implemented a dynamic music system that
                switches between the "sleep" and "awake" versions of the music
                in response to changes made during gameplay.</li>
              <li>Engineered a means of looping both tracks seamlessly and
                simultaneously, and also a means of fading smoothly between each
                version.</li>
              <li>Streamlined the integration of this music system by wrapping
                all of this functionality under 1 C# method call in Unity. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Technology Used: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Built objects in Unity and scripted them in C# using Visual
                Studio.</li>
              <li>Music produced with SunVox.</li>
              <li>Sounds edited with Audacity.</li>
            </ul>
