            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p><i>Antithesis</i> is a virtual reality game that features
              asymmetric multiplayer gameplay, with one player using the VR
              headset and another player using a PC. The player on the VR
              headset must navigate a dark, spooky village in search of four
              ritual components, while the player on the PC watches them from
              overhead and sends monsters to defeat the player before they can
              complete their ritual. This project was made on a team of over 20
              Northeastern University students and faculty members as part of
              the Fall 2020 Game Studio course. </p>
            <p>I worked on a team of five other student developers, making
              regular use of Northeastern's VR lab for both development and QA
              testing. I was responsible for implementing some of the game's
              systems:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Organizing the health, strength, and speed of the player and
                all enemy monsters, as well as a system for applying temporary
                modifications to these attributes.</li>
              <li>Interactions between the player and the monsters, such as the
                player's ability to kick away the monsters and each monster's
                ability to damage the player.</li>
              <li>A way of recording the speed of the player's hands and head,
                in order to allow them to shake off rats that climb onto them
                and slow them down.</li>
              <li>The non-VR player's ability to summon lightning and fire to
                obstruct the player.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The development team and I worked closely with each other and
              frequently helped each other solve problems, find bugs, and learn
              more about game programming as a whole. I look forward to being a
              part of a project of this scale once more! </p>

            <h2> Accomplishments: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Collaborated with 5 other Unity developers.</li>
              <li>Researched multiple different kinds of virtual reality
                technology available today.</li>
              <li>Rapidly developed a feature-packed game prototype playable in
                virtual reality over the span of 3 months.</li>
              <li>Implemented game mechanics to the specifications of our game
                design team, and made it as easy as possible for them to
                experiment with these mechanics themselves.</li>
              <li>Designed heavily abstractable code that my fellow developers
                could easily expand on and rapidly develop new features.</li>
              <li>Organized and ran 2 QA tests at different stages of
                development.</li>
              <li>Cross-communicated with several other teams working on other
                aspects of the game, such as art, sound, and UI/UX.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Technology Used: </h2>
