            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p>This project is a recreation of Atari's Breakout!, as a learning
              project for working with low-level tools and techniques for
              writing game engines. The project is written in C++ using SDL2 to
              render the game objects and play sounds.</p>
            <p>This project is fairly stripped down, as it had a short deadline.
              However, I am proud of the object-oriented design that I came up
              with for its implementation. In summary, the game is designed in a
              way that isolates the behaviour for individual objects from the
              rest of the engine code. This allowed me to make more recyclable
              components, like object and resource managers, that I can use for
              future projects of this nature.</p>
            <p> If I had more time, here are some features and mechanics I would
              like to add: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Image assets for the game objects - a resource manager already
                exists to make this easy, I simply need to change how the
                objects are rendered.</li>
              <li>Different mechanics for earning points in a level - ideally, I
                would like to reward the player more points for breaking more
                bricks before the ball reaches the paddle again.</li>
              <li>Multiple balls in one level - I think it would be interesting
                if each brick had a rare chance of spawning more balls, creating
                some chaos but also allowing the player to break more bricks.</li>

            <h2> Accomplishments: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Composed several homemade and recyclable code components together into one game project.</li>
              <li>Implemented game engine components at a very low level.</li>
              <li>Applied resource management techniques to increase game performance.</li>
              <li>Utilized several other low-level game programming techniques, including frame capping and the use of subsystems.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Technology Used: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>SDL2 for graphics and audio</li>
              <li>Code in C++</li>
              <li>Built for Linux</li>
