            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p>This project is a recreation of Atari's Breakout!, as a learning
              project for working with low-level tools and techniques for
              writing game engines. The project is written in C++ using SDL2 to
              render the game objects and play sounds.</p>
            <p>This project is fairly stripped down, as it had a short deadline.
              However, I am proud of the object-oriented design that I came up
              with for its implementation. In summary, the game is designed in a
              way that isolates the behaviour for individual objects from the
              rest of the engine code. This allowed me to make more recyclable
              components, like object and resource managers, that I can use for
              future projects of this nature.</p>
            <p> If I had more time, here are some features and mechanics I would
              like to add: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Image assets for the game objects - a resource manager already
                exists to make this easy, I simply need to change how the
                objects are rendered.</li>
              <li>Different mechanics for earning points in a level - ideally, I
                would like to reward the player more points for breaking more
                bricks before the ball reaches the paddle again.</li>
              <li>Multiple balls in one level - I think it would be interesting
                if each brick had a rare chance of spawning more balls, creating
                some chaos but also allowing the player to break more bricks.</li>

            <h2> Accomplishments: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Collaborated with 5 other Unity developers.</li>
              <li>Researched multiple different kinds of virtual reality
                technology available today.</li>
              <li>Rapidly developed a feature-packed game prototype playable in
                virtual reality over the span of 3 months.</li>
              <li>Implemented game mechanics to the specifications of our game
                design team, and made it as easy as possible for them to
                experiment with these mechanics themselves.</li>
              <li>Designed heavily abstractable code that my fellow developers
                could easily expand on and rapidly develop new features.</li>
              <li>Organized and ran 2 QA tests at different stages of
                development.</li>
              <li>Cross-communicated with several other teams working on other
                aspects of the game, such as art, sound, and UI/UX.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Technology Used: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Unity Engine for game development</li>
              <li>Visual Studio for programming in C#</li>
              <li>Discord used for communication with the team</li>
              <li>Unity Collab used for remote collaboration</li>
              <li>Zoom used for meetings</li>
              <li>Oculus Quest &amp; Oculus Quest 2 used for development and QA</li>
              <li>Oculus link used for asymmetric play</li>
            </ul>
