            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p>This project is a group-driven bullet hell game, in which the
              flow of time depends on how fast the player is moving. When the
              player stops moving, time stops progressing, and vice versa. The
              project currently has no title, and is still in development. </p>
            <p> I am currently responsible for most of the programming,
              including player controls, enemy behaviours, and other systems.
              The most prominent system present in the game is its way of
              handling the many bullet and enemy objects that are constantly
              spawned. In the game, enemies and the player can potentially fire
              hundreds of bullets in a short period of time. Instantiating each
              of these bullets on demand is extremely inefficient, and is bound
              to cause massive frame rate issues. So, I designed a system that
              generates a sufficient amount of every object needed to be spawned
              before a level begins. When a bullet is fired, it is "spawned" by
              taking a bullet from the pool of cloned objects, revealing it,
              moving it to its origin position, and given a velocity and
              direction to move along. When the bullet ends its life cycle, it
              is hidden and stowed away until it is needed once more. variety. </p>
            <p> I eventually expanded this system to be used for spawning
              enemies and drops to be picked up by the player, too. With this
              system, the limit on how many bullets the player and any enemy can
              fire is many magnitudes higher, which allows for more </p>

            <h2> Responsibilities: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Quickly designed game mechanics and system with 2 other
                groupmates.</li>
              <li>Conceived an object-management system that spawns and stows
                pre-generated copies of objects, overcoming the limitations of
                generating hundreds of on-screen bullet objects on demand.</li>

              <li>Designed multiple scalable systems for the game, serving
                purposes such as UI navigation, inventory management, and
