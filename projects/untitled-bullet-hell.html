            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p>This project is a group-driven bullet hell game, in which the flow of time depends on how fast the player is moving. When the player stops moving, time stops progressing, and vice versa. The project currently has no title, and is unfinished. This project features several systems that are feature-complete, such as a bullet-pooling system to save computer resources, and a UI navigation system used for the level select screen. </p>
            <p> This project serves as a proof-of-concept for bullet hell game mechanics. My group and I collaborated on some design aspects of the game, and the game features their art, too. I primarily focused on the game's code and construction within Unity. I designed and developed systems for level navigation, UI navigation, an item shop, and bullet-pooling. The latter system seeks to reduce the lag that comes from handling hundreds of bullet objects by instantiating the objects before a level begins, rather than spawning them on-demand. This way, the cost to fire a bullet object in the game is reduced to near-zero, allowing for greater freedom of design. </p>

            <h2> Responsibilities: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Quickly designed game mechanics and system with 2 other
                groupmates.</li>
              <li>Conceived an object-management system that spawns and stows
                pre-generated copies of objects, overcoming the limitations of
                generating hundreds of on-screen bullet objects on demand.</li>
              <li>Applied object-oriented design strategies to create scalable game systems, serving purposes such as UI navigation, inventory management, and dynamic enemy placement in the levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Technology Used: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Game developed in Unity.</li>
              <li>Code written in C# using Visual Studio.</li>
              <li>Git used for collaboration, hosted on GitHub.</li>
            </ul>
