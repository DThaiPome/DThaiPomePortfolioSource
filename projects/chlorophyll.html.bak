            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p>
              <i>Chlorophyll</i> is a fast-paced time management game prototype, designed to comment on the stress that students with worsened mental health go through. Throughout the game, the player must split their time between maintaining the health of a potted plant and completing a barrage of assignments that arrive regularly. Each assignment is a puzzle that must be fully solved. The player can partially solve it and still submit it, but this will cause the health of the plant to deteriorate faster.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was made as a final project for my Games & Society class. The actual assignment was only to produce a game design document, which we did too, but we also wanted to go a step further and produce a functional, aesthetically-decorated prototype. While my teammates worked on the graphics and user interfaces, I programmed the game mechanics and systems. In particular, I anticipated that we may expand on the project further. So, while the prototype only has one type of assignment, a Lights out! puzzle, the code is structured in an heavily object-oriented manner such that new types of assignments can be added without rewriting any code.
