            <h2> Summary: </h2>
            <p> Fillball is a small, self-driven game project developed in
              Unreal Engine 4. The player controls a ball that can change
              between 4 colors by collecting small color pickups, passing
              through colored hoops, or pressing colored buttons. Changing the
              ball's color changes which paths are solid and passable; the
              player must strategically manage their current color, particularly
              if they wish to collect every color pickup. Through this project,
              I am learning how to program game behaviour and systems using C++,
              and I am familiarizing myself with the many features of UE4. Right
              now, 3 levels are planned for this project. </p>

                project.</li>
              <li>Designed &amp; implemented color-switching system in C++.</li>
              <li>Streamlined development by utilizing C++ objects and scripts
                within other Blueprint components, reducing compile times and
                allowing for speedy debugging.</li>
              <li>Created simple and aesthetically pleasing graphics by
                utilizing Unreal's flexible material editor.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> Technology Used: </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Game built in Unreal Engine.</li>
              <li>Code written in C++ using Visual Studio.</li>
              <li>Some graphics assets made using GIMP.</li>
