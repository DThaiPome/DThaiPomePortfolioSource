            "Hi! My name is Ryan Gehrlein, and I am a third-year Computer Science and Game Development student at Northeastern University. I aspire to get involved in the game industry as a software engineer. I develop games as a hobby, as well as fun bots to play around with while I stream games on my Twitch channel. Recently, I have been exploring low-level engineering concepts, particularly surrounding game engines and real-time graphics. Right now I am practicing these concepts further while also learning about computer networking.",
            "During the day, I enjoy exploring Boston and other nearby areas. When I get tired of that, I play video games with my friends. I enjoy using games like Minecraft, Super Smash Brothers, Jackbox, and other social games to connect with friends. I have also been drumming for the NU Pep Band for three years now!"
